# Tomorrow's hAIr — RIT Senior Project Team Website

This is a simple, static website for the RIT Senior Project team "Tomorrow's hAIr." It presents the project overview and synopsis, team members and roles, weekly time tracking with charts, weekly 4Ups (Progress, Risks, Plans, Needs), and project artifacts such as the domain model.

The site is frontend‑only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Chart.js). Content is maintained in the repository (e.g., `data.js` for time tracking and `4ups-data.js` for weekly 4Ups). Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
